20042022: added sub split_genome_sequences_per_chr_bedtools to _collinear_genes (uses faster bedtools)
20042022: adopted minimap2-2.24 and updated Makefile
22042022: save compressed copy of $merged_tsv_file as evidence of clusters
22042022: check_evidence.pl prints basic stats for a cluster
05052022: check_evidence.pl -f prints GFF fixes for long gene models
06052022: check_evidence.pl -f prints sorted- non-overlapping GFF fixes for long gene models
11052022: check_evidence.pl -f tested for split and missing gene models, premature stop codons tracked
11052022: GFF patches, maybe created with check_evidence.pl, can now be used with get_pangenes.pl -p, existing WGAs reused
20052022: prints WGA stats summary
27052022: check_evidence.pl -s -r oryza_sativa_RAPDB,oryza_sativa_MSU appends to file mode isoform sequence, preferring refs
02052022: check_evidence.pl locates internal stop codons in CDS sequences, those cannot be used to fix gene models
07062022: check_evidence.pl skip long segments with candidate long/split genes, uses $MAXSEGMENTSIZE
09062022: check_evidence.pl sub liftover_gmap calls validates lifted CDS sequences with sub no_premature_stops
21062022: check_evidence.pl split models only fixed if mapped gene overlaps >= MINFIXOVERLAP=0.75
21062022: check_evidence.pl long models only fixed if mapped gene pair overlaps >= MINFIXOVERLAP=0.75
29062022: added _dotplot.pl to produce dotplot figures with R package pafr
14072022: added _chunk_chr.pl to break long chromosomes in chunks separated by geneless stretches (testing only)
30082022: tested get_pangenes.pl with rice, barley and wheat
12092022: check_evidence.pl -f -v prints out GMAP alignments, -p allows for partial CDS lift-over
13092022: check_evidence.pl -f does not use long/short isoforms for lift-over
09022023: fixed segments with flipped species while producing PAF in _dotplot.pl
20022023: get_pangenes.pl stops if 0 genes parsed from GFF
